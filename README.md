## Note: Version 4 is under development and breaking in many respects.

Version 4 has a very different setup (see below under versions). For now v3.3.4 is more complete in conjunction with the StatisticalRethinkingStan (v3) and StatisticalRethinkingTuring (v1) projects.

## Purpose of this package

The StatisticalRethinking.jl v4 `package` contains functions comparable to the functions in the R package "rethinking" associated with the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath. 

These functions are used in the Pluto notebook `projects` specifically intended for hands-on use while studying the book or taking the course.

To work through the StatisticalRethinking book using Julia and Stan, download `project` [StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl) and open one of the chapter Pluto notebooks.

A start has been made with a similar [project](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl) using Julia and Turing, but unfortunately only the first 5 chapters have been completed. I just don't have the time to continue to work and complete that project. Luckily there is an excellent other package, [TuringModels.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/TuringModels.jl) that contains a selection of the Statistical Rethinking models in Turing.jl's PPL. There is also [Shuma](https://github.com/Shmuma/rethinking-2ed-julia) which is another good starting point to use Turing.jl.

Along similar lines, I would love to see a StatisticalRethinkingDhmc.jl, which could be a combination of Soss.jl and DynamicHMC.jl, and a StatisticalRethinkingMamba.jl!

If interested in either of these projects, please contact me!

## StatisticalRethinking v4

This is a breaking change from v3 of StatisticalRethinking.jl. Breakage occurs because over time more and better options become available to express the material covered in Statistical Rethinking. Examples are the recently developed ParetoSmooth.jl for PSIS related examples, KeyedArrays as introduced in AxisKeys.jl for the representation of mcmc chains and the new graphics option with Makie.jl and AlgebraOfGraphics.jl. Also, an attempt is made to make StatisticalRethinking.jl fit better with the new setup of Pluto notebooks which keep track of used package versions in the notebooks themselves ([see here](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/wiki/üéÅ-Package-management))

If you prefer to continue using v3, you can use `] add StatisticalRethinking@v3.x.y` where 3.x.y is the latest released version for v3. 

Given that Julia provides several very capable packages that support mcmc simulation, it only seemed appropriate to make StatisticalRethinking on Julia mcmc implementation independent.

The availablility of DynamicHMC, the huge progress made by the Turing.jl team over the last 2 years, the introduction of Julia `projects` in addition to Julia `packages`, the novel approach to notebooks in Pluto.jl and the work by [Karajan](https://github.com/karajan9/statisticalrethinking) and currently [Shuma](https://github.com/Shmuma/rethinking-2ed-julia) were a few of the ideas that triggered exploring a new setup for StatisticalRethinking.jl and the 'course' projects [StatistcalRethinkingStan](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl) and [StatisticalrethinkingTuring](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl)

An early, experimental version of [StructuralCausalModels.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StructuralCausalModels.jl) is also included as a dependency in the StatisticalRethinking.jl package. In the meantime I will definitely keep my eyes on [Dagitty.jl](https://github.com/Shmuma/Dagitty.jl), [Omega.jl](https://github.com/zenna/Omega.jl) and [CausalInference.jl](https://github.com/mschauer/CausalInference.jl). In particular Dagitty.jl has very similar objectives as StructuralCausalModels.jl and over time might replace it in the StatisticalRethinkingJulia ecosystem. For now, StructuralCausalModels does provide ways to convert DAGs to Dagitty and ggm formats.

The in v3 added introduced dependency [StatsModelComparisons.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatsModelComparisons.jl) which provides PSIS and WAIC statistics for model selection is deprecated in v4. For PSIS and LOO ParetoSmooth.jl is now used and WAIC has been moved to StatisticalRethinking.jl

Finally, for a good while I have been looking for a great statistics book using Julia as kind of an introductory text to StatisticalRethinking and I believe the first couple of chapters in an upcoming book [Statistics with Julia](https://statisticswithjulia.org/index.html) by Yoni Nazarathy and Hayden Klok are exactly that.

As [StatisticalRethinking](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia) v3/4 is also (DrWatson & Pkg) project based and uses Pluto notebooks, I have converted the book `listings` in the first 5 chapters to Pluto Notebooks in a new repository in StatisticalRethinkingJulia, i.e. [StatisticsWithJuliaPlutoNotebooks](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticsWithJuliaPlutoNotebooks.jl). 

After chapter 4, `Statistics with Julia` follows the frequentionist approach while `Statistical Rethinking` opts for the Bayesian approach. Most of the material in chapters 5 and 6 of `Statistics with Julia` is therefore also covered using a more Bayesian perspective in the early chapters of the notebook projects [StatisticalRethinkingStan](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl) and [StatisticalRethinkingTuring](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl). 

## Versions

### Version 4.0.0 (under construction!)

- Drop the heavy use of @reexport.
- Switch to ParetoSmooth.jl
- Switch to AxisKeys.jl for mcmc chains if Stan(Sample) is used.
- Enable a switch to Makie.jl and AlgebraOfGraphics.jl by moving all graphics to StatisticalRethinkingPlots and StatisticalRethinkingMakie (in the near future).
- Use projects to set up the needed Julia environment to run the examples, e.g. StatisticalRethinkingStan and StatisticalRethinkingTuring.
- Refine 'tailoring' StatisticalRethinking.jl and the graphics packages based on the availability of StanSample, Turing.jl, etc. using Requires.jl.

### Versions 3.2.1 - 3.3.6

- Improvements by Max Lapan.
- Introduction of StatsModelCoparisons.jl for PSIS and WAIC.
- Removed dependencied on DynamicHMC (will be covered in StatisticalRethinkingDHMC)
- Added trankplot.jl
- Further separation of methods needed to convert output of mcmc package to SR inputs
- Add compare() and plot_models() abstractions.
- Manifest.toml updates.

### Version 3.2.0

- Option to retieve sampling results as a NamedTuple
- Added new method to plotbounds() to handle NamedTuples
- Added plotlines()

### Versions v3.1.1 - 3.1.8

- Updates from CompatHelper
- Switch to Github actions (CI, Documenter)
- Updates from Rik Huijzer (link function)
- Redo quap() based on StanOptimize
- Start Updating notebooks in ch 2-8 using new quap()
- Redoing and updating the models in the models subdirectory

### Version 3.1.0

Align (stanbased) quap with Turing quap. quap() now returns a NamedTuple that includes a field `distr` which represents the quadratic Normal (MvNormal) approximation.

### Version 3.0.0

StatisticalRethinking.jl v3 is independent of the underlying mcmc package. All scripts previously in StatisticalRethinking.jl v2 holding the snippets have been replaced by Pluto notebooks in the above mentioned mcmc specific `project` repositories.

Initially StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl will lag StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl somewhat but later this year both will cover the same chapters.

It is the intention to develop *tests* for StatisticalRethinking.jl v3 that work across the different mcmc implementations. This will limit dependencies to the `test/Project.toml`.

### Version 2.2.9

Currently the latest release available in the StatisticalRethinking.jl v2 format.

## Installation

To install the package (from the REPL):

```
] add StatisticalRethinking
```

but in most cases this package will be a dependency of another package or project, e.g. StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl or StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl.

## Acknowledgements

Of course, without the excellent textbook by Richard McElreath, this package would not have been possible. The author has also been supportive of this work and gave permission to use the datasets.
